## Deployment Link

## Description

This project utilizes Jquery and HTML implmentation within the Jquery utiizing bootstrap codes for class identifiers, minimizing the usage of CSS. Users can store tasks and change the classification of each tasks on whether the task is done or not, with the classifiers added such as the due date and other more attributes.

## User Story

AS A project team member with multiple tasks to organize,

I WANT a task board,
SO THAT I can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress and track overall project progress accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a task board to manage a project,

WHEN I open the task board,
THEN the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed).

WHEN I view the task board for the project,
THEN each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red).

WHEN I click on the button to define a new task,
THEN I can enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog.

WHEN I click the save button for that task,
THEN the properties for that task are saved in localStorage.

WHEN I drag a task to a different progress column,
THEN the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing.

WHEN I click the delete button for a task,
THEN the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing.

WHEN I refresh the page,
THEN the saved tasks persist.

I'd like to give credit for the starting code given by the Columbia University and the additional code implementation for button Jquery that was found in one of the modules inside the course.
